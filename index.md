## SOFTWARE ENGINEER

## SUMMARY
 
I was interested in software engineering since late 
elementary school, and it stayed my passion 
throughout my life. I want to make cool stuff, be it 
video games, software that actively helps people, 
or a useful library. I'm always eager to learn new 
technologies, programing languages, best 
practices, etc. My career comprises of 5 years of C# 
work, which I had to learn on the job - and I 
enjoyed every second of that learning process. 
Feeling of staying in place is what kills projects for 
me.
As I get older, I get more and more principled 
about my work content. I am definitely not willing 
to work with cryptocurrencies/NFTs, Apps/Games 
with predatory monetization schemes, companies 
selling user data. I don't want to contribute my 
time and skill to something that hurts people or 
this planet. It may lock me out of some 
opportunities, and I embrace that.
